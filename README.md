# ChadaTech-Clock
For my project I had to create a code that would run a real life clock. I think I definitely did well on the rendering of the clock. I think I could definitely enhance my code in the if parts of the code that would check. For 60 minutes, 60 seconds and 24 hours. I definitely think the if block was the hardest part. You had to make sure every single statement was correct, or then calculations wouldn't be correct and your code would simply not work. I definitely think the experience with the efflux and the calculations of time will definitely be helpful in my next projects. I made sure to add comments and make my variable names as readable as possible.
